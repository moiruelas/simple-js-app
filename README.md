# simple-js-app as a Pokedex

# The goal of this project is to create a responsive pokedex application. The application will allow a user to search for individual Pokemon and display a button with the Pokemon's name and image. When a user clicks a Pokemon button it will open a modal with the Pokemon name, image, and some additional information such as height type(s), number, and moves. The modal will also have arrows to shift the modal to the next Pokemon before displaying that Pokemon name.

# This application is made using HTML, JavaScript, CSS as well as using Bootstrap framework.
